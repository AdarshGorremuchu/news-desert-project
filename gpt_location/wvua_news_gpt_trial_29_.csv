Hale County's new storm shelters are almost ready,https://www.wvua23.com/hale-countys-new-storm-shelters-are-almost-ready/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Zoe Blair In February, Hale County received almost half a million dollars in funding for new storm shelters. Now, five months later, two of the shelters are almost complete. Hale County was hit by six tornadoes in 2022 and 2023. At the time, the county's nearly 15,000 residents only had one storm shelter. Soon they'll have four more, thanks to funding from U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell. Hale County Emergency Management Agency Director Russell Weeden said the county has needed the shelters for a long time. ""All these years, we haven't had a safe place for people to go,"" Weeden said. ""Putting these storm shelters in is really a game changer."" The four shelters will be in Greensboro, Sawyerville, Akron and Moundville, and the shelters in Sawyerville and Akron locations are nearly complete. ""We poured concrete on those two about three weeks ago and they're actually bringing those shelters in on Monday,"" Weeden said. Crews will also pour the concrete on the Moundville shelter on Monday. Weeden said the Hale County community is excited about the new shelters ahead of the tornado season later this fall. ""They're very, very excited because we've never had storm shelters here,"" he said. ""They've really just had to kind of make do. They could see the tornado warning, but a lot of times they'd stay in their mobile home because they didn't have a safe place to go."" The shelters will have restrooms, benches on each side and middle, and a backup generator. Between the four shelters, nearly 400 residents will be able to stay safe during a storm. ""It's for an EF5 tornado, so it really is a safe place versus somebody's basement or site-built home, so it really is a safe place to go,"" Weeden said. Weeden said Hale County EMA is currently working with FEMA to get six more shelters in the county.",26-07-24,"WVUA 23 News,","hale county, hale county ema, storm shelter, tornado preparation","Featured, Local News",26-07-24,"Greensboro, Alabama / Sawyerville, Alabama / Akron, Alabama / Moundville, Alabama"
"Diving into Alabama's opponents: Week 14, Auburn",https://www.wvua23.com/diving-into-alabamas-opponents-week-14-auburn/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Josh Batchelor Alabama hasn't won five straight Iron Bowls since Paul W. ""Bear"" Bryant won nine straight against Auburn from 1973 to 1981. Kalen DeBoer can be a part of a feat that hasn't been achieved in more than four decades. The Crimson Tide is currently the 13.5-point favorite. While Jordan-Hare produces nail-biting finishes on the regular, Alabama has been dominant in home games against Auburn. Nick Saban won every home game against Auburn except 2010. The Tigers return seven starters on offense, with three of the four newcomers at the receiver position, the other being left tackle. Michigan State transfer Payton Thorne enters his second year starting at quarterback for Auburn. His production has dipped every year since 2021 in which he threw for over 3,200 yards. In his first year on the plains, Thorne threw for only 1,755 yards and 16 touchdowns. Jarquez Hunter is as experienced as any running back in the conference, as he has totaled 2,000 yards combined over his last three seasons. Thorne finished second in rushing yards above second-string running back Damari Alston. The receiving core is full of new faces, as Hugh Freeze hit the recruiting trail and the transfer portal hard for pass catchers. Cam Coleman, a true freshman from Central-Phenix City High School in Alabama, was one of the highest ranked recruits in the entire 2024 cycle. Fellow freshmen receivers Perry Thompson, Bryce Cain and Malcolm Simmons assembled one of the better receiving recruiting hauls out of high school and provided much needed depth at the position. Penn State transfer KeAndre Lambert-Smith could be the Tigers' go-to wideout, as he has the most college experience. The fifth-year senior had over 1,600 yards in four years with the Nittany Lions, scoring 12 touchdowns in the process. Robert Lewis transferred over from Georgia State and has the highest single season receiving yards total as any player on the team, with 877 yards last season. Rivaldo Fairweather returns at tight end for Auburn after leading the program with 394 receiving yards in 2023. Auburn has four returning starters along the offensive line, namely center Connor Lew. Percy Lewis transferred from Mississippi State to play left tackle. Auburn didn't have a player drafted until day three of the 2024 NFL Draft, but five players heard their names called in rounds five to seven. Freeze hit the portal hard in need of depth, but only two players are expected to start right away: defensive lineman Isaiah Rakes from Texas A&M and safety Jerrin Thompson from Texas. Along the front seven, Keldric Faulk and Jayson Jones played frequently for the Tigers last season. They will be expected to have an expanded role with defensive linemen Justin Rogers and Marcus Harris heading on to the NFL. Senior edge rusher Jalen McLeod led the team with 5.5 sacks in 2023 and finished third in tackles. Eugene Asante led the team with 86 tackles and will be paired with newfound starter Austin Keys at the middle linebacker position. Freeze landed several highly ranked in-state linebacker commits such as Demarcus Riddick and D.J. Barber that will provide depth at the position. Cornerback Antonio Kite flipped sides of the rivalry, transferring from Alabama to Auburn after Nick Saban's retirement. Former Alabama and Colorado defensive back Jahquez Robinson recently joined the Tigers program as well. With Nehemiah Pritchett and Jaylin Simpson moving on to the NFL, there will be competition for defensive back spots. Former Alabama defensive backs coach Charles Kelly returned to Auburn to coach safeties. Prior to the Thanksgiving weekend matchup, Auburn hosts the Texas A&M Aggies, while Alabama travels to Oklahoma.

"""We're just asking for transparency:' Northport residents voice concerns over University Beach development",https://www.wvua23.com/were-just-asking-for-transparency-northport-residents-voice-concerns-over-university-beach-development/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Zoe Blair District 5 Northport City Council Member Anwar Aiken held a town hall Wednesday night with a full agenda of items to discuss, but only one topic made it to the floor. Questions surrounding $350 million University Beach development took up the entirety of the hour and a half event. ""The University Beach project has been on the mind of just about everybody in District 5 and Northport for that matter,"" said Northport resident Tuffy Holland. ""We're just asking for transparency."" Residents from every district in the city packed the gym at Northport Intermediate School in the quest for answers to their many questions. Was there a traffic study? What will be the impact of the nearly 100-acre project on the wastewater treatment plant? How will the development impact neighboring subdivisions? But the biggest question, by far? Is there a way Northport can back out of this development? Aiken didn't have an answer for every question, but he said he's going to take those questions and concerns to the full council to make sure they're heard. ""I've definitely got a to-do list,"" Aiken said. ""I don't see it as just my to-do list, I see it as the council's to-do list. Constituents from all the districts have questions about University Beach and if we're going to do a partnership with them, they deserve answers."" Many residents like Holland said their biggest issue with the project is the lack of information available to the public. ""There hasn't been any information put out,"" he said. ""The information that we've got, we don't know if it's right or wrong and we're just very concerned with it."" The proposed water park would be located just off U.S. Highway 82 near Big Lots. That's an awkward space for a massive lagoon, a water park, hotels, condos and retail space, residents say. ""I haven't talked to anybody that is actually for this, especially in the location that it is,"" Holland said. ""It's shoehorned in between two well-established subdivisions, and I know that makes a lot of people mad. That's in addition to the fact that we just don't think it's viable in Northport."" Aiken, who was appointed to the District 5 seat in the wake of the sudden resignation of former Council President Jeff Hogg in March, made it clear at the meeting that he's also against the development. ""I'm against it,"" he said. ""I don't like the location, I don't like it by Buckhead or Shirley Farms. I see some red flags as it kind of relates to the development as a whole."" The town hall didn't ease many of the residents' concerns, but they were grateful for this opportunity to voice their issues with the project. ""No, (Aiken) didn't ease any of my concerns,"" Holland said. ""The biggest thing he did is to have this meeting,"" Holland said Northport residents are not giving up on trying to stop this development. Holland and a group of residents are currently involved in a lawsuit to get more information about the project. Thelawsuit was funded by that group of residentswho raised money from the community to try and prevent the development from happening.

Pell City man gets nearly 6 years in prison for financial fraud scheme,https://www.wvua23.com/pell-city-man-gets-nearly-6-years-in-prison-for-financial-fraud-scheme/,"A man from Pell City was on Tuesday sentenced to 71 months in prison in the wake of a scheme to defraud more than 40 investors in his companies out of more than $4.7 million, the U.S. Department of Justice Northern District of Alabama announced. John Michael Golden, 48, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in April. According to the plea agreement and information provided at sentencing, Golden was the founder and owner of Wolf-Tek, LLC; MountainTop Timber, LLC; and DroneTek, Inc. Between January 2018 and at least October 2023, Golden devised a scheme to persuade individuals to invest in his companies. He misrepresented his companies investors by telling them his businesses were about to be sold for millions of dollars to companies like Amazon, that he had timber leases and an ability to harvest timber for profit, and that he had hundreds of preorders for drones that he needed capital to fulfill. Golden also gave some investors Promissory Notes in which he falsely promised lucrative returns on investments within a short period of time. Golden even defrauded a new victim eight days after originally signing a plea agreement. To continue his scheme, Golden placated victims by sending them text messages falsely claiming that their money was available and would arrive on specific future dates. Golden subsequently had his bond revoked for contacting victims and making false promises to them regarding repayment. He ultimately defrauded investors in his companies out of more than $4.7 million. He used the funds to pay back prior investors and for personal expenses. The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the case, with assistance from the Alabama Securities Commission. Assistant United States Attorney Ryan Rummage prosecuted the case.",24-07-24,"WVUA 23 Digital,",,"Crime, Local News",26-07-24,"Pell City, Alabama"

NBA Summer League Tide Hoopspic.twitter.com/81nibVisnS - Alabama Men's Basketball (@AlabamaMBB)July 24, 2024  Many players competed to earn roster spots, whether that be a NBA contract, 2-way contract or G-League contract. The former SEC Player had a phenomenal NBA rookie season, finishing third in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting behind Victor Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren. The Charlotte Hornets star is heading into his sophomore campaign and didn't have much to prove in the summer league. Miller played in just one game, scoring 23 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Miller's one game sample size of 23 points per game ranked fourth among all players. Miller's first round draft pick partner from 2023 showed flashes in year one for the Brooklyn Nets and its G-League affiliate. Clowney has an opportunity to increase his role for a struggling Nets' franchise in need of immediate contributors. ""Stretch"" played in five games this summer, averaging 13.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.6 blocks per game. A hard-hat aficionado, Ellis personifies what it meant to be a 3-and-D player. He has steadily improved his role in the Kings organization to be a 2-way player in the 2022-2023 season to ultimately starting games for the Kings this past system. Ellis played in three summer league games, averaging 32 minutes a game. He averaged 12.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. He signed a 3-year contract with the Kings in February 2024 worth $5.1 million. NBA Champion JD Davison has made his mark in the G-League the past two seasons and looks posed to make the NBA jump. He resigned with the Celtics in early July on a 1-year $578,000 contract. In three games, the former Alabama point guard averaged 12 points, 3 rebounds and six assists. he also shot a remarkable 55.6 percent on three-point shots. The Huntsville native has struggled to solidify himself on a NBA team since being drafted with the 13th pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Injuries and role instability have caused him to be fighting for a roster spot. He spent five years in New Orleans before being traded to the Pacers, Raptors and Jazz in 2024. He spent this summer league with the Houston Rockets and played in five games. In a limited minutes, Lewis Jr. tallied 4.6 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1 assist per game. The Hofstra transfer made a significant impact in his lone season in Tuscaloosa and parlayed it into a undrafted free agent deal with the Detroit Pistons. Estrada played in five games and 13.4 minutes per game. He averaged 5.6 points, 1.8 rebounds and 2.2 assists. Few people were as unlucky as Charles Bediako this past year. He took a leap and tested his chance in the NBA waters. After going undrafted, he was signed by the San Antonio Spurs and was automatically in the large shadow of Wembanyama. He suffered a torn MCL and the Spurs cut him from his contract. The Magic picked him up for the summer league, averaging 3.7 points and 2.3 rebounds off the bench. The lefty shooter has solidified himself as a constant contributor in the loaded Oklahoma City Thunder system. He has spent the last few years playing for its G-League affiliate average double-digit scoring numbers. Shackelford maintained similar numbers this summer playing in 25 minutes per game across four contests. He averaged 13.8 points, 2.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. He also shot 46.9 percent from beyond the arc. One of the biggest surprises of the summer league in Alabama basketball circles was the former big man earning a summer league opportunity with the Portland Trail Blazers. After years playing overseas, Reese may have given NBA franchises to consider him for a G-League deal.

In March, the Council had designs to demolish the bridge, but Tuscaloosans spoke out against it, saying it's a well-used gateway for residents traveling from nearby neighborhoods to Veterans Memorial Hospital and the Tuscaloosa County Park and Recreation Authority's McAbee Center. The council listened, and agreed to figure out ways to improve the bridge. Four months later, the first step has been funded. The $9,700 will pay for a professional consultant to determine what work is required for the bridge. City Council President Kip Tyner said the bridge is vital to residents in that community. ""Unfortunately, we've had quite a number of tragic accidents lately that have taken many lives, and crossing Veterans Memorial Parkway would be like a speedway,"" Tyner said. ""So we definitely need it. I'm looking forward to their results, and looking forward to making the bridge great again."" Tyner said the Council believes the bridge is structurally sound, meaning improvements would cost much less than the hundreds of thousands of dollars the proposed demolition would have. He said rust and pain removal will likely be the first steps. At the same meeting, the Council approved ending its 13-year agreement with Red Mountain Entertainment, the contractor responsible for bringing concerts and other acts to the Mercedes-Benz Amphitheater. The agreement officially ends Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, 2025, the city will begin a new contract with Danny Wimmer Presents. Tyner said he believes this new partnership will bring bigger and better entertainment options to Tuscaloosa. ""I think not only will we see bigger and better acts, I think we're going to see maybe double the number of shows that we did this year,"" Tyner said. ""I believe that the community will be so thrilled when we are able to really let everyone know what kind of acts that we'll be able to bring now."" The Council also voted on executing an ingress, egress and access to city utilities in the location of a proposed Neighborhood Walmart on Alabama Highway 69 South at the intersection of Patriot Drive.

""Living in a small town, nobody thinks somebody that cruel would just live here,"" Bibb County resident Brittany Russell said. In Russell's case, ""somebody that cruel"" is 32-year-old Brandon Allen Kendrick II, who's facing five capital murder charges in the July 18 deaths of his wife, their two children and a relative's two children. As a mother, Russell said it's impossible to understand how someone could do something so heinous. ""I couldn't imagine anybody wanting to hurt their flesh and blood,"" Russell said. Centreville Mayor Mike Oakley said the horrific events that unfolded at the Bibb County home Thursday are beyond comprehension. ""As a father, a grandad and as a mayor of a city, you pledge to protect your citizens,"" Oakley said. ""It's just hard to comprehend what would push somebody to do that,"" Oakley said. On Monday, Kendrick pleaded not guilty by mental disease or defect to the charges in his first court appearance following the killings. ""Anybody that does this is mentally unstable, but that doesn't mean anything,"" Russell said. ""I still think that justice should be served because he did do it, whether he remembers or not."" West Blocton Mayor Daniel Sims said what happened is a tragedy, but it also shines light on where improvements and changes are needed moving forward. ""I think we could do a better job with outreach and be a little more proactive in situations like this so it doesn't have to happen again,"" Sims said. Sims said the West Blocton Police Department has plans to equip their officers with the tools, training, knowledge and resources needed to help residents who need help getting out of domestics violence situations.

"Diving into Alabama's opponents: Week 13, at Oklahoma",https://www.wvua23.com/diving-into-alabamas-opponents-week-13-at-oklahoma/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Josh Batchelor Alabama and Oklahoma have split their last two matchups, both of which came in the postseason. Oklahoma came out on top in the 2014 Sugar Bowl, while Alabama defeated the Sooners in the 2018 Orange Bowl. This will be the first time Alabama has played Oklahoma since the 2003 season, when the Sooners came into Tuscaloosa and beat Alabama. The two also faced off the year before in which Oklahoma won. The Crimson Tide currently has a 2-3-1 record against the Sooners. In its last season in the Big 12, Oklahoma went 10-3 under second year head coach Brent Venables. The Sooners beat its Red River rivals, the Texas Longhorns, but consecutive losses to Kansas and Oklahoma State prevented them from making the conference championship. The Sooners lost one of the best players in the country and its starting quarterback, Dillon Gabriel, to the Oregon Ducks via the transfer portal. Gabriel threw for 3,660 yards and 30 touchdowns which ranked ninth in all of college football. Former five-star Jackson Arnold will replace Gabriel as the Sooners starting quarterback. Arnold got as much experience as any backup freshman quarterback, as he threw for 563 yards and four touchdowns. He started the Alamo Bowl instead of the transferring Gabriel, but threw three interceptions in a 38-24 loss to Arizona. Gavin Sawchuk returns as the starting running back, amassing 744 yards on 120 carries which was good enough for 6.2 yards per carry. He amassed nine touchdowns, but that tally will likely go up as Gabriel led the Sooners in rushing touchdowns this past season. The Sooners return three of its top four receiving leaders in Nic Anderson, Jalil Farooq and Anfrel Anthony. All three will look for increased production as Drake Stoops, the leading receiver, graduated and moved on to the NFL. The tight end room will be 60% newcomers, as the Sooners added two from the transfer portal and one from the high school ranks. The Sooners utilized wide receivers far more, as six receivers had more yards than tight end Austin Stogner. Offensive tackles Tyler Guyton and Walter Rouse were two of three Sooners players selected in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Sooners offensive line will have several first-year starters for the program, many of whom joined from the transfer portal. The Oklahoma defense is returning numerous starters, namely linebacker Danny Stutsman who led the team in tackles and finished second in sacks. Billy Bowman Jr., the Sooners strong safety, tied for the second most interceptions in college football last year with six sacks. The game is set for Saturday, Nov. 23, in Norman, Oklahoma.

Alabama shad could be added to Endangered Species Act,https://www.wvua23.com/alabama-shad-could-be-added-to-endangered-species-act/,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service is suggesting the Alabama shad needs protection under the Endangered Species Act. Alabama shad have been wiped out from 60 of the 75 Southeast and Midwest rivers they once inhabited,according to an NOAA study. ""This is an exciting step toward finally protecting a fish that's vital to this country,"" said Will Harlan, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Alabama shad have been a key part of our most vibrant rivers, from the Mississippi to the Suwannee. Protecting these fish will help restore rivers and communities across the South, and our health depends on theirs."" The announcement kicks off a one-year review of the fish's status to determine if it qualifies for federal protection. The Alabama shad is a slender, silvery fish that grows to 1.5 feet in length and weighs up to 3 pounds. They migrate from the Gulf of Mexico upriver to spawn each year and were previously so abundant that they supported commercial fisheries. Many rivers where they once migrated and spawned are now blocked by dams. In Alabama, biologists have observed 98% population declines in rivers that once teemed with Alabama shad. Oil spills in the Gulf also have likely contributed to Alabama shad declines. Populations plummeted after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2011 and have never recovered. Last November the Main Pass Oil Spill - the Gulf's second-largest oil spill after Deepwater Horizon - spewed at least 1.1 million gallons of oil into key Alabama shad habitat near the mouth of the Mississippi River. Joining the Center in the Alabama shad petition are the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians, Alabama Rivers Alliance, Healthy Gulf, American Whitewater, Cahaba Riverkeeper, Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, Coosa Riverkeeper, Forest Keeper, Healthy Ocean Coalition, Mobile Baykeeper, Pearl Riverkeeper, Black Warrior Riverkeeper and Choctawhatchee Riverkeeper.",23-07-24,"WVUA 23 Digital,","alabama shad, endangered species act, national marine fisheries service, NOAA","Alabama News, Local News",26-07-24,"Mobile, Alabama / Mississippi, Alabama"

Theso-called DEI bill, officially named Senate Bill 129, requires all public education institutions dismantle their DEI programs and end the instruction of ""divisive concepts."" You can read the bill in its entiretyright here. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bill into law in March, and the bill goes into effect Oct. 1. According to Bell's statement, UA is making modifications to ensure compliance with the bill and is opening a new Division of Opportunities, Connections and Success. The new division will be run by G. Christine Taylor, who was named UA's vice president as associate provost for diversity, equity and inclusion in 2017. You can read Bell's statement in its entirety below: The University of Alabama serves a critical role in the growth of the educational, economic and social condition of the State of Alabama and our nation. A significant factor in our success is the continuous development of opportunities for students and employees of all backgrounds and beliefs to access this institution, connect with others, enhance our campus community, and achieve their academic and professional goals. Recent changes to state and federal laws prompted a comprehensive review of campus programs, resources and initiatives to ensure they are committed to student and employee success and comply with applicable law. It is important to note we will continue to provide resources and support to every member of our campus community, as our commitment to each individual's success remains steadfast. Among other modifications UA is making to ensure compliance, the Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion will close. Our mission has not wavered, and we remain committed to our institutional goals to welcome all, serve all and see all thrive and succeed. To that end, Dr. Christine Taylor will lead the new Division of Opportunities, Connections and Success, an organization charged with promoting success for everyone in the UA community. Dr. Taylor possesses a wealth of experience in the areas of student and employee access, engagement and achievement. Under her leadership, OCS will offer three primary initiatives that support our goal of preparing all students and employees for success on campus and beyond: ""More information is available on the new division'swebsite. ""Information related to Alabama Act 2024-34 (formerly SB 129) isavailable online, and additional details and guidance will be shared in the weeks ahead as we approach the Oct. 1 enforcement date. Some website updates and other processes may take time to go into effect. We appreciate The University of Alabama System leadership, including legal and government affairs, and their guidance throughout this process to help ensure our mission of teaching, research and service remains the priority. Differences, including differences of opinion shared with civility, strengthen our campus community. Our faculty, staff and students will continue to engage in free speech, exercise academic freedom, and join in wide-ranging thought and discussion on issues that impact our world. UA has seen tremendous gains over the past decade - in enrollment and in creating an atmosphere where every individual, regardless of background, can be successful. We graduate more students than any other institution in the state, building an even stronger workforce and contributing to a growing economy and more engaged society. That commitment remains as strong as ever, and our institutional goals remain steadfastly dedicated to providing resources to equip all members of our campus community. We will continue to assess how we can best serve our campus community and achieve those goals, and I appreciate every student, faculty and staff member who works diligently to support these efforts.

Amid all-star weekend, the MLB Draft took place from July 14 to July 17. The Crimson Tide was active on all three days, six players total got the call from MLB franchises. Alabama had two Top 100 prospects in starting pitcher Ben Hess and third baseman Gage Miller. Hess was a fringe first round prospect, as he was ranked No. 44 among draft prospects according to MLB.com.

Hess, a fringe first round prospect, wasn't expected to be selected until the second round. However, the Yankees selected ""Heater"" with the 26th pick in the first round. Hess held a 12-6 record, a 4.81 ERA, 205 strikeouts in 30 starts for the Crimson Tide. Miller also ranked in the top 70, coming in as the No. 68 ranked prospect. While Hess was selected above his prospect grade, Miller fell to the third round, as he was selected by the Miami Marlins with the 92nd pick in the third round. He had a phenomenal one-year stint in Tuscaloosa holding a .381 batting average, 18 home runs and a 1.176 OPS. Four more rounds passed before Alabama saw its next selection. The San Francisco Giants selected Greg Farone, another Alabama starting pitcher. Like Miller, Farone spent his last year of college baseball in Tuscaloosa. The Louisville transfer had a 5.02 ERA and 68 strikeouts in a season where he developed to be a weekend starter for coach Rob Vaughn's squad. Ian Petrutz joined Vaughn in Tuscaloosa after playing for him at Maryland. The Terrapins transfer was drafted in the 12th round by the St. Louis Cardinals after hitting for a .321 average, six home runs and 40 RBIs out of left field. Pierce George only played in 15 games in two years of college, 12 of those which came this past season at Alabama. The Texas transfer had a 4.76 ERA and was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the 13th round. The White Sox stayed in Tuscaloosa with their 16th round pick, picking up outfielder T.J. McCants. The Ole Miss transfer spent his final season in Tuscaloosa and was a reliable bat in the lineup with a .306 average, 15 home runs and 50 RBIs.

"""It sounded like a war:' Resident describes Wednesday morning shooting near Kaulton Park",https://www.wvua23.com/it-sounded-like-a-war-resident-describes-wednesday-morning-shooting-near-kaulton-park/,"The Tuscaloosa Violent Crimes Unit is investigating after one person was injured and several homes were shot into around 8:45 a.m. Wednesday near Kaulton Park. The Tuscaloosa Police Department and VCU cordoned off portions of the intersection of Elm and Pine streets, the intersection of Pine and Asher streets, and a section of Kaulton Road. In addition to the person who was shot, several homes and a car were hit by bullets. In the hours after the shooting, evidence markers remained scattered throughout the streets, and police K9 units and drones aided law enforcement personnel in the investigation. More than a dozen officers were still at the scene as of 12:30 p.m. Around 4:45 p.m., VCU Capt. Jack Kennedy said two adults and two juveniles were arrested and charged in connection with the shooting.You can read that update right here. Sherry Elmore, who lives in the area, said she was awoken by the gunfire. ""They lit off. It sounded like a war,"" Elmore said. Elmore said she moved into the neighborhood a year ago. And she's thankful her family and property were not damaged in the shooting, because her neighbor two doors down wasn't so lucky. ""I pray for the neighbor because it could have been worse,"" Elmore said. WVUA 23 News spoke with several residents who said they heard the gunshots.Â  None wanted to go on camera, but said they're frustrated, upset and tired of the gun violence impacting the community. Elmore said she's become so accustomed to the sound that she initially brushed it off. It wasn't until after she got multiple text messages from her son and friends that she decided to step outside and check on the situation. ""It's scary because you never know who's going to just ride by and start shooting for whatever reason,"" Elmore said. ""You don't know where they're going to go. You're just blessed if they don't hit you."" It's reality for Elmore and everyone else who lives in the area. ""You're hearing it more and more now than when I got here. We've just been hearing them left and right,"" Elmore said. While police routinely patrol the area and are often seen riding around the neighborhood or sitting at the park, they can't be everywhere at once. ""I don't think there is anything that can really stop it,"" Elmore said. ""It's just the people. There's no way to keep guns off the streets, or guns out of the wrong person's hands because they're going to find them one way or another."" The shooting victim was taken to DCH Regional Medical Center for treatment.

"DeBoer, Saban have first televised discussion at SEC Media Days",https://www.wvua23.com/deboer-saban-have-first-televised-discussion-at-sec-media-days/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Josh Batchelor Alabama fans would be shocked to the core if they knew in December 2023 that Nick Saban would be at SEC Media Days, but not as the Crimson Tide head coach, but rather a member of the media. Kalen DeBoer was the first coach to take the stage at SEC Media Days on Wednesday. He notably praised his predecessor for winning the Icon Award at ESPYs on July 11. After DeBoer outlined his vision for the season to the media, the SEC Network panel of Nick Saban, former Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy and former Alabama safety Roman Harper discussed the coaching change at their former homes. DeBoer has a formidable record of 104-12 as a head coach from his time at Sioux Falls, Fresno State and most recently Washington. Saban explained his main takeaway from DeBoer's speech. ""I think what everyone is trying to point to is: ""We want to win,'"" Saban said. ""Tyler Booker wants to win, Malachi Moore wants to win, and Jalen Milroe wants to win. They know how to win, we've won before. Kalen DeBoer has won before. The style to win will be different, but the ingredients and intangibles it takes to win are the same. I think he's done a really good job of doing that."" Saban maintained that he hasn't stepped into the Mal Moore Athletic Facility since his retirement. With such a massive footprint on the program, Saban expressed his intentions on maintaining a respectable distance from the program. ""The reason I don't go into the building isn't because I don't love the players because I do love the players,"" Saban said. ""I don't want to be a distraction to the people that are trying to establish what they are doing with the players. I have players come and see me now...so what can we do to help them win,"" Saban said. DeBoer later joined the desk with Saban, Harper, McElory and host Dari Nowkhah and talked about developing a relationship with Saban. ""I just can't say enough about how (Saban) has been gracious in any time I've given him a call,"" Deboer said. ""He knows the facility is always open to him. It's been awesome to have him as a resource in Tuscaloosa."" Saban responded saying he and Roman Harper, the two defensive minds on the panel, would never criticize DeBoer. Saban responded with a friendly jab at his former quarterback, saying McElroy thinks he should be the one calling the plays. McElroy was one of the players Saban inherited from the Mike Shula era in Tuscaloosa. A similar feat is happening with freshman wide receiver Ryan Williams, who committed to Saban in 2022, but swiftly decommitted after Saban announced his retirement. After landing the job, DeBoer and wide receivers coach Jamarcus Shephard quickly got Williams back in the fold with his recommitment in January. Both Saban and DeBoer had high praise for the 17-year-old freshman phenom. ""The thing that's impressed me most about Ryan is his maturity in understanding what the commitment level that it takes in this program,"" coach DeBoer said. ""He's already putting in the extra time and he's just a playmaker. You can see that in the little things that we've done with him this summer. He's got the name recognition and infectious personality that makes him fun to be around."" ""I think it's really important to note guys like Ryan that had the patience to give you the opportunity to go and visit with him, instead of bolting without making an evaluation,"" Saban said. ""Alabama is a special place and you're going to do a great job. I appreciate the Ryan Williams of the world that did that."" One of the common traits shared by DeBoer, Saban and McElroy was the commitment to winning. McElroy was the quarterback on Alabama's undefeated 2009 team under coach Saban, meanwhile DeBoer is 104-12 in his head coaching tenure. DeBoer explained how he has dealt with the few losses on his resume. ""I think (Saban) has been in the same boat,"" DeBoer said. ""The one's I really remember are the 12 losses...those are the one's that drive me crazy and are the hardest talks. It's your ability to respond that really matters.""",17-07-24,"WVUA 23 Digital,","alabama football, greg mcelroy, kalen deboer, Nick Saban, Roman Harper, SEC Media Days","Alabama, College Sports, Local News, Sports",26-07-24,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama / Sioux Falls, South Dakota / Fresno, California"

Kalen DeBoer praises returning leadership at SEC Media Days,https://www.wvua23.com/kalen-deboer-praises-returning-leadership-at-sec-media-days/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Josh Batchelor It isn't often that teams return two captains from the previous season. The University of Alabama has had the fortune of returning two captains twice in the past three seasons. Bryce Young and Will Anderson were two-time captains in 2021 and 2022. Now, Malachi Moore and Jalen Milroe are returning leaders after captaining the 2023 team. Moore, Milroe and Tyler Booker joined head football coach Kalen DeBoer at SEC Media Days Wednesday morning in Dallas. Alabama's first-year coach started off his media address with high praise for the leaders brought with him to Dallas. ""These guys have been special from the beginning,"" DeBoer said. ""They are three of the guys that never wavered from the beginning. They believed in themselves, the program and our coaching staff as we presented and made the hires. They stayed steady and because of their leadership, the program has continued to grow."" DeBoer developed first-round draft pick Michael Penix in his time at Washington, but also in his last coordinator stint at Indiana. He emphasized utilizing Milroe's one-of-one talent, but also helping him develop to consistently make throws all across the field. ""He has a skillset that is special,"" DeBoer said. ""He can make you pay with his arm and make all the throws. He tirelessly works with the receiving core and all the skill position players to be on the same page. He dives into it, there's no one that's going to beat him into the football facility. He's there at 4:30, for sure 5 a.m. every morning. He's doing everything mentally and physically to be ready for this fall."" Milroe and Moore are two of Alabama's most vocal leaders hence being captains in 2023. However, DeBoer praised both players for how they set a great example for the rest of the team. ""Guys like Malachi, Jalen, Booker all understand what it takes,"" DeBoer said. ""Malachi is front and center, and very similar to Jalen. They love the game, the work associated with it and bring a smile. Malachi is helping build a secondary that has some youth."" DeBoer referenced leaning on veterans like Moore, Deontae Lawson and other Alabama-born players for learning about Alabama culture. ""I took notes and am still taking notes,"" DeBoer said. ""These guys have been here longer than I have. We have a saying ""You don't know what you don't know.' I want to do things the way I have done them in some aspects, but embracing the traditions that have been here for many years too."" Alabama also lost its fair share of players to the transfer portal before and after Nick Saban retired. DeBoer rebuffed his secondary by landing DaShawn Jones, Keon Sabb, Kam Howard and King Mack. Before coach DeBoer arrived, cornerback Domani Jackson joined the Crimson Tide from USC. ""Overall between the winter and spring portal, we picked up 14 guys,"" DeBoer said. ""They don't just add depth to the program, they make a difference.""",17-07-24,"WVUA 23 Digital,","Jalen Milroe, kalen deboer, Malachi Moore, tyler booker, university of alabama football","Alabama, Alabama News, College Sports, Local News, Sports",26-07-24,"Dallas, Texas"

Moundville residents' cleanup efforts get accolades online,https://www.wvua23.com/moundville-residents-cleanup-efforts-get-accolades-online/,"Two men in Moundville are getting some major attention after their good deeds were caught on camera by an Alabama State Trooper. Jeromy C. Johnson, a member of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency's Marine Patrol Unit, saw Dexter Byrd and Scotty Sanders at a Moundville boat ramp Sunday taming the overgrown grass and cleaning up accumulated trash. Johnson took pictures and shared their work on the publicWhat's Happening in MoundvilleFacebook group. The post is not embeddable, but you can view it on Facebookright here. Byrd and Sanders said they ran into each other while fishing at the boat ramp several years ago and struck up a friendship. That friendship and their shared love of fishing soon evolved into a weekly cleanup project at the ramp about two years ago. ""I feel like that's a part of my civic duty,"" Byrd said. ""It's my way of giving back and showing appreciation for nature, for wildlife and for the city of Moundville."" Cleanup of the area is the responsibility of the city of Moundville, but the area itself is owned by the University of Alabama. WVUA 23 News reached out to the city of Moundville and was told the city cleans the area regularly but does not clear brush. ""We all want to come down here and have fun and feel safe,"" Sanders said. ""It's kind of like community policing. You see it, just take the initiative."" Byrd and Sanders began picking up trash, cutting shrub overgrowth and maintaining the area because the overgrowth just off the ramp is a breeding ground for snakes and can be dangerous to traverse. ""As a father it makes me worried. It makes me nervous, "" Byrd said. Byrd and Sanders started cleaning up so everyone could be safe by the ramp, whether they're launching a boat or setting up shop and fishing. They said they hope their effort's visibility gives more people who use Alabama's waterways a reason to join them in keeping nature beautiful. ""It's not just here. We fish all over different places throughout the Black Warrior River,"" Sanders said. If you're heading out into nature, consider bringing a bag with you so you can clean up whatever you leave behind alongside anything else that shouldn't be there. ""If we have to sit here and get recognition for (cleaning up the boat ramp), then the community is not doing its job as a whole,"" Sanders said. But it's an easy fix.

Tuscaloosa Metro Animal Shelter buckling under distemper testing costs,https://www.wvua23.com/tuscaloosa-metro-animal-shelter-buckling-under-distemper-testing-costs/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Paislee Roberts Tuscaloosa Metro Animal Shelteris seeking the community's help with mounting expenses as the organization battles against a deadly canine distemper virus outbreak. A second round of distemper testing was given to dogs at the shelter last week, and the results will be in soon. During round 1 of the testing, TMAS checked 141 dogs. Of those, 36 were positive. Distemper is a virus that affects a dog's neurological system, and half of adult dogs and 80% of puppies that are diagnosed do not survive. Many dogs that do survive are left with permanent neurological issues. A multi-dose vaccine for distemper exists, but many animals arriving at the shelter are not vaccinated. Testing is expensive, said TMAS Health Manager Abby Moore, and there's still quite a ways to go before the shelter can be declared distemper free. ""We were quoted originally $15,000 for all the initial testing,"" Moore said. ""We haven't been billed for it yet, so we don't know the exact number. Each test is approximately $200 just for the test itself, not including personal protection equipment."" Gloves, shoe covers and gowns are all examples of personal protection equipment required for any shelter dealing with an outbreak to avoid accidental spread of the virus. TMAS will continue testing its dogs until all results are negative.

"Tuscaloosa County middle, high schools will start screening for weapons when students arrive",https://www.wvua23.com/tuscaloosa-county-middle-high-schools-will-start-screening-for-weapons-when-students-arrive/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Paislee Roberts Middle and high schools within the Tuscaloosa County School System will be a little safer when students start back, as anyone coming into the building will have to pass through new weapons detection systems. The devices, which look largely like a metal detector but are a bit higher tech, will be installed at the main entrances of each middle and high school before the beginning of the 2024-25 academic year. All other entry doors outside the schools' main entrances will remain locked at all times. TCSS Director of Student Services Ty Blocker said keeping students safe is the system's primary concern. ""This is familiar technology that you may see when you go to a football or basketball game,"" said Blocker. ""We received the Lieutenant Governor's Grant and we chose to use that funding to set these systems up as a way to show our safety in our school buildings."" This is the first time the Tuscaloosa County School System will be using the weapon detection system in any of its schools. The new system is also throwing a wrench into students' hydration habits, as Tuscaloosa County High School made a Facebook post Monday informing parents and students that metal water bottles or cups including the mega-popular Stanley cup will no longer be allowed at school. Instead, only transparent plastic water bottles or cups will be allowed.",16-07-24,"WVUA 23 News,","school safety, tuscaloosa county school system","Featured, Local News",26-07-24,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama / Tuscaloosa County, Alabama"

"Diving into Alabama's opponents: Week 11, at LSU",https://www.wvua23.com/diving-into-alabamas-opponents-week-11-at-lsu/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Josh Batchelor Kirby Smart is undoubtedly the best coach in the SEC. Many people debate who is the second best coach in the SEC, whether it is Steve Sarkisian at Texas, Brian Kelly at LSU or Kalen DeBoer at Alabama. The Week 11 matchup will provide some clarity to that debate, especially with DeBoer's 2-0 record against Sarkisian. LSU was a one faceted team in 2023. Take that from no other than coach Kelly, who stated the need for more balance at SEC Media days on July 15. The Tigers did have an electric offense headlined by Heisman winner Jayden Daniels and star wide receiver duo of Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr. However, all three were rightfully selected in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. At the quarterback position, the Tigers turn to Garrett Nussmeier who threw for over 1,700 yards as a backup quarterback in his first three seasons. He will be as experienced as any backup turned starter in the conference and is no stranger to playing against the Crimson Tide, as he relieved an injured Daniels last year in Tuscaloosa. Replacing Thomas and Nabers will be as big of a challenge as replacing Daniels, simply because of their 2,600 combined receiving yards and 31 touchdowns. Kyren Lacy proved to be a very viable third option in 2023 and will likely step into the primary target of Nussmeier's. The Tigers also have Alabama transfer Aaron Anderson, Chirs Hilton Jr. and Liberty transfer C.J. Daniels to make plays. LSU's best player returning may be the best player in the country for his position. Look no further than Will Campbell who is expected to be the first lineman off the board in next year's NFL draft. Veteran tight end Mason Taylor, who broke Alabama fans hearts in 2022, will return for his third year as a primary contributor on offense. Suprisingly, LSU didn't hit the portal hard on defense after down year. Jardin Gilbert, a Texas A&M transfer, will likely start at safety for the Tigers. Major Burns and Greg Penn III led the team in tackles in 2023 and return for their final season. Harold Perkins Jr. is the name to know on defense. After having an immense freshman campaign with 7.5 sacks, Perkins Jr.'s sack numbers dropped by two whole sacks from 2022 to 2023. His position change from an edge rusher to a middle linebacker, his current position, played a large factor. Both teams will have a bye week to prepare for one of the most competitive SEC matchups on a yearly basis. Many Alabama players will be making their debuts inside Tiger Stadium, which is commonly deemed the toughest road environment in all of college football. Even after Jalen Milroe's four rushing touchdown performance in 2023, the Tigers are favored at home against the Crimson Tide on Nov. 11. Alabama will host Mercer the following week, while the Gators travel to Gainesville.",16-07-24,"WVUA 23 Digital,","alabama football, Brian Kelly, kalen deboer, LSU football, Tiger Stadium","Alabama, Alabama News, College Sports, Local News, Sports",26-07-24,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama / Baton Rouge, Louisiana / Gainesville, Florida / College Station, Texas / Tuscaloosa, Alabama"

Day 1: Alabama GOP leaders discuss Republican National Convention,https://www.wvua23.com/day-1-alabama-gop-leaders-discuss-republican-national-convention/,"Monday kicked off the first day of theRepublican National Conventionin Milwaukee. The RNC comes two days after anassassination attemptagainst former president Donald Trump at his rally in Pennsylvania. Despite the horrific events that unfolded, Trump is still expected to attend the RNC as planned and announced his selection for vice-president. ALGOP chairman John Wahl, former Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, and other party delegates are in Wisconsin for the four-day convention. Merrill said the shooting on Saturday was devastating for everyone involved, but it's not deterring the RNC. Republicans have rallied behind the party's presidential nominee in the wake of 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Pennsylvania firing shots at Trump. ""The support for President Trump since the shooting on Saturday is more enthusiastic, more energetic, more dynamic than it's every been in his political career,"" said Republican Party delegate and former Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. The RNC is held in a swing state, however Wisconsin GOP delegate Brian Schimming said he knows which way voters will go in November's election. ""We've had 12 elections in 24 years in this state that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes. We are truly a purple state and this year we are here to turn it red. It's that simple,"" Schimming said at the RNC delegation breakfast. While Alabama is a red state, Merrill believes there will be outstanding support for Trump in November and ""that will be reflected in the 5 million people in the great state of Alabama."" A lot has happened in the 48 hours leading up to the RNC, and it's shifting the tone Trump plans to set during the convention. He told ""The Washington Examiner"" his RNC speech will focus on unification,""according to the Associated Press"" ""Donald Trump is very much so showing leadership and what you want to see out of a presidential candidate, out of a president. You're seeing a candidate who is going to come forward, he's going to change his message to unity and really talk about it like we can get past it,"" Wahl said. Republican Party leaders are excited about what's to come during the rest of the campaign, and a recent legal battle is out of the way after the judge presiding over Trump's classified documents trial tossed the case Monday. ""I think we're seeing some justice in the courts you also had JD Vance named as the VP candidate, he's literally walking on stage right now here in Milwaukee about to address the delegates and it's an exciting time for the Republican party,"" Wahl said.",16-07-24,"Avery Boyce,","2024 presidential race, alabama GOP, republican-national-convention","Alabama News, Local News",26-07-24,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"

Both Turnbull and Robertson are playing for franchises that competed for league pennants in the 2023 season. Turnbull spent the first five years with the Detroit Tigers, who dramatically struggle to win games since Turnbull was called up in 2018. He held a 12-29 record and a 4.55 ERA. The Phillies fell short to the Diamondbacks in the NLCS last year, but now boast the best record in all of baseball at 59-32.

The Rangers are the eighth franchise he has played for, also spending nine years with the Yankees, three seasons with the White Sox, two years with the Phillies and several one-year stints with the Mets, Rays, Rangers, Cubs and Marlins. Despite his age, Robertson is still a highly coveted relief pitcher due to his consistency. He holds a 65-45 record, a 2.90 career ERA and has 176 career saves.

World Drowning Prevention Day is July 25. Here are some water safety tips,https://www.wvua23.com/world-drowning-prevention-day-is-july-25-here-are-some-water-safety-tips/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Candace Johnson July 25 isWorld Drowning Prevention Day, and on this day, it is especially important to be cautious when near water. Drowning is one of the top ten leading causes for death for children ages 5-14. Tuscaloosa County Park and Recreation Authority's Director of Aquatics and Outdoor Pursuits Mark Harrison was more than delighted to offer some water safety tips. ""Drowning is the No. 1 cause of unintentional death for children ages 1 through 4, and it is also the second leading cause for children ages 5 to 14, right behind motor vehicle accidents,"" said Harrison. PARAtakes water safety seriously, and each pool under their umbrella has lifeguards available during operating hours. The organization also offers year-round swimming lessons for children ages 4 to 13. If you're an adult looking to learn or brush up on the basics, PARA offers private swimming lessons for adults. Harrison has some advice for the parents of children who cannot swim but are eager to dive in. ""For kids who are non swimmers, just watch the kids very closely around their quality facilities,"" said Harrison. ""They need to be watched and monitored constantly."" Another precaution for non-swimmers is to wear a fitted life jacket that is approved by the Coast Guard. You may be surprised to know that swim toys like noodles or arm floaties should not be used in place of a personal flotation device. Drowning can occur in any body of water, and can happen when water is less than a foot deep. If you're lucky enough to own your own pool, it should be surrounded by a fence on all four sides. A 4-foot fence with a locked gate is the minimum recommended for protection. ""If you are going to be swimming in the lake, then you want to scout out the area, make sure that it's clear,"" said Harrison. ""Make sure there's no debris or dead fall in the water in the designated smoothing area."" Harrison said his No. 1 bit of advice is to learn how to swim if you find yourself around water with any frequency.

New book highlights Tuscaloosa's allure,https://www.wvua23.com/new-book-highlights-tuscaloosas-allure/,"By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Jolencia Jones Becky Beall is a travel writer and native Alabamian who recently authored ""100 Things to Do in Tuscaloosa Before You Die."" The book features a variety of exciting summer activities that cater to different interests. For those who love water sports, there's the option to gear up for fun on the water with Tuscaloosa Paddleboard Rentals or to watch water-ski competitions at Lymanland. On the other hand, adventure seekers can get dirty at Tuscaloosa Mud Park. At the same time, those looking for relaxation can unwind at the Venue Tuscaloosa or choose nature at Lake Lurleen State Park. Fishing enthusiasts can enjoy Lake Tuscaloosa, and fitness buffs can stay fit at Faucett Brothers Activity Center. Beall expressed a deep connection to the state of Alabama and the University of Alabama as inspiration for her book. However, she wanted to highlight Tuscaloosa as a destination beyond its football fame, highlighting its museums, art galleries, outdoor activities, and dining options. ""In terms of traveling, I think that we miss out on telling people why they could come to Tuscaloosa as a getaway,"" Beall said. ""I think we miss out on all that because everybody has the preconceived notion that it's just a college town with a great football team and they don't see the value in Tuscaloosa."" During the writing process, Beall expressed how her favorite part was the extensive research that went into it. ""I absolutely loved meeting people, and I didn't get to meet everybody that I wrote about. Some were just establishments but that was my favorite part, just getting to find out little tidbits of information that I didn't know,"" Beall said. The journey to create this guidebook hasn't been easy. Throughout the process, Beall shared how she was involved in a car accident that delayed the project. ""It kind of set me back. It was pretty significant, and I was not able to do a lot of the research or sit at the computer and type for very long. I just had a lot of issues to work through. So that was probably the hardest part for me, just getting to a healthy point in my life where I could finish it,"" Beall said. Despite the challenges, she persevered and eventually released the book in May. ""It's just a good, all around, very affordable way to plan your travel to Tuscaloosa,"" Beall said.

Tuscaloosa River Market celebrates Sweet Grown Alabama Day with farmers,https://www.wvua23.com/tuscaloosa-river-market-celebrates-sweet-grown-alabama-day-with-farmer/,"WVUA 23 News Reporter Caleb Aguayo Sweet Grown Alabama Day took overTuscaloosa River Marketon Saturday, inviting a constant stream of foot traffic into thefarmer's marketall morning. The event ran from 7 a.m. until noon, and the market's vendors said they schedule time out of their day to come take part not only in the festivities but also in the weekly farmers market. ""I work at Starbucks in the morning, and in the evening I work at the restaurant too, so I have two jobs in one day. And this is my passion. This is how I like it,"" said vendor Yuriko Junmee. She serves homemade snacks at her booth, Sweet Secrets by Yuriko. In fact, everything sold at the farmers market was made or grown by the vendors. The Tuscaloosa Farmers Market brings a weekly average of almost 3,000 visitors, and River Market operations manager Alexis Clark said Sweet Grown Alabama Day helps local farmers from all around the state. ""The farmers market here in Tuscaloosa is made up of 30 farmers from the state of Alabama,"" Clark said. ""All of the fruits and vegetables that you get from the farmers market here are grown within 25 miles of the state line of Alabama."" Each year, the River Market sends an agent to every vendor's home location to verify that they make or grow everything on-site. This ensures no one buys and resells anything at their booth, as if they had actually made it. But the River Market's vendors don't mind the extra step because their products keep people coming back for more. ""It stays pretty busy when I'm not at my shop, but on Saturdays is when I get the majority of my customers,"" said vendor Pamela Dobbins. ""I've created a lot of consistent customers, so they look for me every Saturday and I enjoy serving when I come out to the market."" Although Sweet Grown Alabama Day celebrates local farmers, the Tuscaloosa Farmers Market will continue to do so for the rest of the summer with more than 50 vendors.

"Back-to-school shopping? Protect yourself from online scams, says BBB",https://www.wvua23.com/back-to-school-shopping-protect-yourself-from-online-scams-says-bbb/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Caleb Aguayo Online shopping scams cost Americans almost $13 billion in 2023, and special sales like Amazon Prime Days are some of the worst times of the year for fake websites and phishing scams designed to grab your personal information. And it's only becoming a larger trend with a growing number of online sales. Better Business Bureau Central and South Alabama President Carl Bates said it's not just a problem for shoppers, either. ""Fraud has become the number one thing that's affecting profitability for these major retailers and people like Amazon and the credit card companies,"" Bates said. Of all complaints made to the BBB last year, Bates said 40% were related to online shopping scams. Of those, nearly 80% who notified the BBB lost money because of the scam. That's why Bates said it's part of your job as an online shopper to always be cautious. ""Stop, call and confirm,"" Bates said. ""Before you buy something, make sure you know what you're buying. Make sure it's the car you want, or the computer you want, or the backpack you want. Look at the specs on it. Look at all the details before you buy it."" In fact, he said the devil is often in the details. ""That's where we get into trouble, is when we don't take our time to realize that we're using a scam site versus the real merchant's site,"" Bates said. But when you are scammed, Bates said it's often not immediately noticeable. ""At the time you've made this, quote, ""purchase,' they're probably only going to charge your credit card whatever the item was that they showed you online. $29.99 or whatever,"" Bates said. ""Now, they could go back a week or 10 days later and charge $100 to your credit card, or $1,000 to your credit card. It would take you a month, at least, to figure that out until you got your statement."" But just being cautious could keep you from becoming the next online victim of theft, yourself. ""Just be careful, whether it's clothing and school supplies or a backpack, or whether it's a computer that you need as an educational resource,"" Bates said. ""It's just something we should all get used to because the scammers are certainly ahead of us on this."" If you find yourself in the middle of an online shopping scam, Bates said you should report it to the BBB, your credit card company and the legitimate seller to let them know of the fraud. Some good rules of thumb for shopping online: Purchase only from well-known websites like Amazon or the online store of a brick-and-mortar business like Best Buy, Target or Walmart If you're searching for items off eBay or similar sites, check sellers' ratings thoroughly before clicking the buy button Use a credit card or a prepaid gift card for online transactions, not a debit card. Credit cards often include additional protections for fraudulent purchases, and prepaid gift cards can't be charged more than the amount on the card",15-07-24,"WVUA 23 News,","back to school sales tax holiday, bbb, online scams, scammers","Alabama News, Featured, Local News",26-07-24,"Central, Alabama / South, Alabama"

First Community Church aims to empower youth,https://www.wvua23.com/first-community-church-aims-to-empower-youth/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Caleb Aguayo First Community Church hosted a service on Sunday, July 14, to empower the local youth from different church denominations around Tuscaloosa. Those at the church said the service was in response to the limited opportunities for children, as well as youth violence that often ends lives. ""In Tuscaloosa City Schools, we have a whole lot of kids, and a whole lot of kids don't get to do a lot of things,"" said church Music Director Caleb Boyd. ""And I don't really like to see that happening because it makes things limited. And I don't like things to be limited because I think every kid should have a chance to do what they want to do."" It's because of Boyd's sentiment that pastor Darrell Gordon and his wife held the church's first service meant specifically for the children. Called Empowering the Youth, the event honored children for moving up in school, gave parents recognition for their work, and brought the children together with an after-party. The after-party featured finger foods, ice cream, snow cones, cotton candy and a video game truck. ""The empowerment comes from them being able to understand and learn that who they are, God created them for a reason,"" said Jackie Hill-Gordon, the pastor's wife. ""And it empowers them. It gives them a way to rethink situations."" In addition to the empowerment, Gordon said the church hopes to teach the children ""to have a change of mind about themselves, first of all."" He added, ""And then we want to try to teach them about making good choices as well."" Gordon said bad choices can lead to ugly consequences and it's his hope that the kids avoid these mistakes early in life. ""We're just trying to teach them to be able to live in this society without getting caught up in the traps of this society,"" Gordon said. Youth Coordinator Dee Alford said the service was ultimately about ensuring the children are aware they're supported in the church. ""We've got to be strong where we stand in church and make sure that they get it here, since they don't get it in so many other places that have banned it,"" Alford said. The service will take place again next summer, but the church will host various community service events in the meantime.",15-07-24,"WVUA 23 News,","community event, first community church, Youth",Local News,26-07-24,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama"

Northport City Council to amend municipal code on property information fees,https://www.wvua23.com/northport-city-council-to-amend-municipal-code-on-property-information-fees/,"By WVUA 23 News Reporter Reba Gist The Northport City Council will hold a second reading at this week's meeting Monday to amend the municipal code regarding fees for public improvement, assessments and property information letters. The proposed ordinance aims to address requests from real estate professionals during property closings, to identify any municipal assessments on a property. Currently, the fee for these assessment letters , which was set at $5 in 1990, is considered outdated. According to agenda item 8.a.1, the council will update these costs to reflect actual costs and time utilized by the city in responding to these requests. The new ordinance would amend Code Section 66-1, updating the fees and offering more options for requesters. The process will transition to an online platform called CitizenServe, where users can select specific information needed. The total cost for all available options will be $155, with possible adjustments based on electronic availability. Kim Braughton, who prepared the ordinance, noted the Finance Committee recommended the amendment during their June 17 meeting. This change is intended to streamline the process and ensure the fees reflect current service demands. The council's approval of the ordinance would mark a significant update to the city's approach to handling property-related information requests, aligning fees with modern standards and enhancing accessibility through digital services.",15-07-24,"WVUA 23 News,","amendment, citizenserve, northport city council",Local News,26-07-24,"Northport, Alabama"

Drought Issues Increasing Across Alabama... Any Rain Ahead?,https://www.wvua23.com/drought-issues-increasing-across-alabama-any-rain-ahead/,"The northern half of Alabama is experiencing some level of drought conditions.Â  On Thursday, new new drought monitor was released and the update highlights a strip of D-2 drought (severe) in a zone from northern Pickens County into Lamar, Fayette and Walker County. The drought classification takes into account soil moisture. If you notice, areas near and south of Tuscaloosa area in an ""Dry"" category or no classification at all. The level ""Dry"" is a step below the moderate drought classification. The map above also lists the rain so far this year in inches and the rain surplus or deficit. Notice the difference between Birmingham and Montgomery!  Let's go back to this date in 2007. Alabama was in the midst of a significant drought period. A D-4 (exceptional) drought covered much of north Alabama, with drought conditions across much of the state. In 2007, the drought only expanded and got much worse. At one point in 2007, nearly all of Alabama was in the D-4 drought classification. It was a disaster for farmers and the water supply. A large number of wildfires also occurred that year due to very dry conditions and performantly low humidity. Will 2024 be a repeat? It is highly unlikely given the pattern ahead.  In the short term, there is good model consistency of a higher number of scattered showers and storms by the middle of next week. Given the nature of scattered storms, some areas will receive a beneficial rain, while others remain dry. According to the Climate Prediction Center, the longer range forecast through August could feature near average precipitation or slightly above average precipitation. That should prevent a significant and widespread drought through the late summer. Historically, September and October are dry for Alabama. Don't be surprised if we have a sudden ramp up in drought conditions by mid to late September.

First, choose complex carbohydrates that are rich in antioxidants and fiber like berries or half a banana. Consider adding dry uncooked oats for additional fiber. When choosing a protein, a plain, nonfat Greek yogurt is a good choice. The third component should be a source of good fats, preferably a combination of monosaturated and polyunsaturated fats from omega-3 fatty acids.

$3.9M grant going into Alabama's roads and bridges,https://www.wvua23.com/3-9m-grant-going-into-alabamas-roads-and-bridges/,"money By WVUA 23 Digital Reporter Candace Johnson The Ivey Administration is continuing their mission to improve Alabama's infrastructure by granting millions of dollars to cities and counties. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey declared on July 11 that $3.9 million of state funding will be given to cities and counties for road and bridge projects. The Rebuild Alabama Act created the Annual Grant Program which is responsible for this grant. The Rebuild Alabama Act, which was passed in 2019 and signed by Ivey, calls for the Alabama Department of Transportation to establish a program to set aside aÂ  minimum of $10 million of the state's share of gas tax revenue to be used for local projects. ""Rebuild Alabama has brought record progress to every single county across this state, and I am proud that we continue delivering road and bridge projects today,"" said Ivey in a statement. Out of the awarded projects, cities and counties have provided over $7 million in local matching funds. Since the Rebuild Alabama Act was born, state transportation funding has been given to local projects in all 67 counties in Alabama. ""The $3.9 million we are awarding will support local projects from the top of the state to the bottom,"" Ivey said. ""As I have said many times, we are just getting started; the Ivey Administration will remain steadfast in our commitment to improving Alabama's infrastructure."" For more information about the grant program, visithere.",12-07-24,"WVUA 23 Digital,","alabama grants, Gov.
