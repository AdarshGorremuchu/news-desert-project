# README for Location Mapping and Geocoding
## Project Overview
This project involves geocoding news article locations and mapping them using Folium and Google Maps API. The code reads locations from a CSV file, geocodes them to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates, and visualizes the data on a map with city and county boundaries. It also handles geocoding errors and outputs results into several files, including a choropleth map and CSV of successfully geocoded locations.

The dataset used for boundary visualization is derived from shapefiles, mainly 'cb_2023_us_cousub_500k', 'cb_2023_us_cousub_500k', and 'cb_2018_us_county_500k'.

You need a Google Maps API Key to geocode the locations.
Replace the placeholder in the code (API_KEY = '') with your actual Google Maps API key.
Shapefiles: Ensure you have the correct shapefiles (cb_2023_us_cousub_500k, cb_2023_us_cousub_500k, cb_2018_us_county_500k) for boundary visualization. These shapefiles should be placed in the map_county_data directory (or update the file paths in the code if different).

CSV Dataset: The input CSV should contain at least a "Locations" column with city and state information in the format City, State / City, State.

How It Works
------------
Geocoding:

The script reads locations from the CSV file, which are in the format City, State / City, State.
It uses the Google Maps API to geocode each city-state pair and retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates.
If a location cannot be geocoded, it is logged for later review.
Mapping:

The code uses Folium to create an interactive map centered around Alabama.
It overlays city and county boundaries using the shapefiles provided.
Geocoded locations are marked on the map, and a choropleth is added to show the frequency of location appearances.
Outputs:

Map: A Folium map showing the geocoded locations and boundaries, saved as news_locations_map.html.
Successful Geocodes: A CSV file, successful_geocodes.csv, which contains successfully geocoded locations and their coordinates.
Failed Geocodes: A text file, failed_geocodes.txt, that logs any locations that could not be geocoded.
Key Code Components
Geocoding Function:

The geocode_location(city, state) function sends requests to the Google Maps API to retrieve latitude and longitude for each location. It handles geocoding errors and retries up to 3 times before giving up.
Map Creation:

The script uses Folium to create a map with markers for each geocoded location. It also uses a Choropleth layer to color the map based on the frequency of location occurrences.
CSV files are read using ISO-8859-1 encoding, and invalid lines are skipped using on_bad_lines='skip'.
Geocoding errors (e.g., if a city or state is not found) are logged and saved to failed_geocodes.txt.
Known Limitations
Incomplete Geocoding: Some locations may not be accurately geocoded, especially if they are not precise enough or if Google Maps doesn't have sufficient data.

Future Improvements
------------
Integrate alternative geocoding services like OpenStreetMap or enhance handling of ambiguous locations to improve geocoding coverage.
Refine the filtering of city/state pairs and improve error messages for failed geocoding attempts.
Files
news_locations_map.html: The interactive map with geocoded locations and boundaries.
successful_geocodes.csv: A CSV file of successfully geocoded locations with their latitude and longitude.
failed_geocodes.txt: A text file listing locations that failed to geocode.

Conclusion
------------
This project combines geocoding, data visualization, and geographical boundary representation to create an insightful map that highlights news article locations. By leveraging Folium and Google Maps, users can explore spatial data interactively.
Try trial_1.py this code is unable to locate all the locations so make changes accordingly ,I also have other code using google API 'map_1.py'try these both and make changes accordingly and in the dataset for boundary we have so many ,I used mainly 'cb_2023_us_cousub_500k'  'cb_2023_us_cousub_500k', and this 'cb_2018_us_county_500k'
